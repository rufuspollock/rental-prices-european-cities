# Rental Prices in European Cities

This is a simple overview of rental costs for a 1 bed apartment in major european cities.

## Some questions

- What are the most expensive cities? And how much do you pay?
- Looking at the data there are some cities where i can rent for under â‚¬400 euros a month!
- That said some of the cheapest cities are Ukraine or Russia. Not sure i'd want to live there right now unfortunately!
- However you can live in Sarajevo (always wanted to go!) for just â‚¬227 a month! ðŸŽ‰
